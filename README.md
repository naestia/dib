# dvb

## The CLI command

The idea behind `dvb` is to create a command that will interactively browse and navigate the linux system through the terminal. The tool is meant for developers to use to make their everyday terminal navigation easier. The program will use the python lib `curses` to take over the terminal and create a visual list of the search term the user inputs.

> NOTE: This will become clearer as soon as the minimum viable product is created.
