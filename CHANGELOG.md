# 0.0.1

## Prelude

This release will be the first one for 'dib'. A tool that will hopefully help people navigate through the file system in an interactive way. See [README](https://github.com/naestia/dib/blob/master/README.md) for more detailed information.

## Features

* 'dib cd' - Like 'dib ls', this is a faster way to navigate to a specific directory without knowing the entire path. See [example usage](https://github.com/naestia/dib/blob/master/README.md#dib-cd).
* 'dib ls' - A faster way to list files in a specific directory. See [example usage](https://github.com/naestia/dib/blob/master/README.md#dib-ls).
* 'dib find' - This command can be used to find files or directories faster. See [example usage](https://github.com/naestia/dib/blob/master/README.md#dib-find).
